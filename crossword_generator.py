	Main function for generating a crossword puzzle.

	PARAMETERS TO SPECITY BELOW:
		grid_dimensions:	  	Size of crossword puzzle grid (rows, columns). Must(?) be Odd x Odd (min. 5x5, max. 24x24)
		black_square_density:	Proportion of grid squares to make black. Be aware that too high of density may cause the program to
								freeze, due to it being unable to generate a legal grid (e.g., if it would result in a 2-letter word)
		word_sample_size:		Number of words to sample from the word corpus for each iteration of the filling process
		penalty_limit:			Number of times program is allowed to reach a dead end before restarting from a clean slate

		"""
		Recursive method to fill the grid with words.

		Strategy works by filling in longest word(s) first, then the most limited/restricted words next (i.e., those with the
		fewest word possibilities for filling). At each iteration, a set of words are randomly picked from the word corpus
		dictionary (the number to pick is specified by 'word_sample_size'), and an attempt to fill each word is performed, at each
		point of which the number of possible words in the resulting grid state is recorded. The word from the pool that results
		in the MOST number of possible words AFTER being filled into the grid is the one chosen to actually fill into the grid.

		The new state of the puzzle grid is then sent back into this function to fill the next word. If a point is reached in
		which no fill is posssible or some other conflict occurs, a 'penalty' point is added and the grid reverts back one or
		more words (can be adjusted by copying the 'self.remove_last_added_word()' call multiple times in a row). Once a certain
		max number of penalties has occurred (specified by 'penalty_limit'), then the grid-filling process starts over from scratch.
